/* Deriving new classes from existing classes such that the new classes acquire all the features of existing classes is called
   Inheritance.

   Inheritance is a concept where new classes can be produced from the existing classes. The newly created class acquires all the
   features of the existing class from where it is derived.

   A child class object can access parent class non-private members.

   Child classes can access parent class public and protected members, but not private members.

   Parent constructor is ALWAYS called before child constructor.
